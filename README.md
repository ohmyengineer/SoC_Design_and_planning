# SoC_Design_and_planning
This repository contains the projects and work I completed during the VSD SoC Design and Planning workshop. It includes various aspects of SoC design, such as architecture, RTL design, physical design, DFT, power management, timing analysis, and project planning. These files showcase the skills and techniques I learned.
